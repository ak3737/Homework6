##Data Understanding

#There appears to be an outlier 
hist(train$revenue)
ggplot(train,
       aes(x = revenue,
           y = visitNumber)) +
  geom_miss_point()

#Mostly equal transaction amounts here BUT
# It looks like Tablet has lower transactions than mobile
# and mobile is less than desktop
# but need to do some missing value imputation (sub in an other category)
ggplot(train,
       aes(x = revenue,
           y = deviceCategory)) +
  geom_miss_point()

#Windows, Mac, and Chrome OS are highest transactions

           y = operatingSystem)) +

##Models

#Model 3 Score was 1.98235
model3 <- lm(data = trainNoOutlier, formula = revenue ~

#Model 4 Score was 1.97586
